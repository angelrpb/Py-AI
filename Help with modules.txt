Hello all

This is the help file
For the audio module in which our assistance listens us, here are the
steps to make it works it one of us run into an AttributeError

def takeCommand():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        r.pause_threshold = 1
        audio = r.listen(source)

The def above need these modules to work in a way
that doesn't show us any error.

import speech_recognition as sr 
#pip install SpeechRecognition
The above is the easy way

The hard way in case it doesn't want to work (my case)
follow This

First verify your python version
by typing into cmd, powershell or terminal 
>_ python --version

Second
type python into the terminal so you can enter to the python shell
and then you will see a text like this:

"PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> python
Python 3.8.5 (tags/v3.8.5:580fbb0, Jul 20 2020, 15:57:54) [MSC v.1924 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information."
The above is the full query, just in case you dont know how to put it
Now i know that my python version is "3.8 and the arquitecture 64-bit AMD64".

Third, then you have to go and find the correct ".whl" file
in the URL: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
for example, mine was python 3.8, AMD64, windows
so my ".whl" file was: pyaudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl

Fourth, after i downloaded the file i choose to install it with admin rights
"PS D:\Descargas> pip install .\PyAudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl"

And this is the result:
Processing d:\descargas\pyaudio-0.2.11-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
Installing collected packages: PyAudio
Successfully installed PyAudio-0.2.11

After that you shall continue with the develop of the AI-Assistant

Greetings
